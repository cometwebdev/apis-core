# The APIS Core

Visit [TheApis Website](https://www.theapis.io/) and check out [TheApis White Paper](https://static.theapis.io/whitepaper.pdf).

The APIS is a decentralized read and write protocol, acting as necessary middleware for the mainstream growth of a fully decentralized internet. Our protocol is community owned, in that at least 70% of API tokens (our native token) will be distributed to the builders that utilize the APIS protocol, with the other 30% going to those who contribute ‘proof of work’ to the APIS protocol. The best way to use the APIS protocol is to build a cool Dapp with it. We work alongside you, so that you don’t need to hire any additional manpower or build any additional infrastructure, while still offering your users all of the best Web 3.0 experiences (DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, etc.). When your Dapp grows like crazy, your corresponding ownership of API tokens will ensure that you never experience the platform risk of the Web 2.0 era. We win as a team.

# Development


## Setup

Clone the apis-core repository

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/The-APIS/apis-core.git
```

Create the .env file at project root and run the build scripts. See `.env-example` for the list of environment variables and defaults.

```bash
cd apis-core/
cp .env-example .env
```

## Run


TL;DR: Using task runner:


```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```


By service or chain:


```bash
# ex: run just the gateway
docker-compose up gateway

# ex: run all ethereum services
docker-compose up ethereum*

# ex: run all bitcoin services
docker-compose up bitcoin*

# ex: run everything
docker-compose up

```



# Production


## Run


```bash
npm run build-production
npm run start-production
```


# Notes

> See individual service README files
> (`gateway` is a good place to start)
