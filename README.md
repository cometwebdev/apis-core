# The APIS Core

Visit [TheApis Website](https://www.theapis.io/) and check out [TheApis White Paper](https://static.theapis.io/whitepaper.pdf).

APIS is a middleware protocol for the functioning of a decentralized
index and querying protocol, allowing for the mainstream growth of a fully decentralized
fnance and decentralized web architecture. Current data index and querying solutions are
either centrally architected, reliant on a party who at all times is subject to numerous
performance and regulatory risks, or logically decentralized, thus requiring an in-depth
knowledge of the public blockchain protocol layer and obscuring the majority of global
developers from interacting with public blockchain infrastructure. APIS is architecturally
decentralized, in that the providers of the endpointed data can be any actor joins the APIS
network, but logically centralized, in that client-side developers will be able to reference
common, frequented API formatting structures, namely RESTful and GraphQL endpoints, to
query datasets generated by public blockchains.
